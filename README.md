This Java-based project implements a web application using the Spring framework to optimize road connections via the Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) algorithm. The app processes data from the Los Angeles Bureau of Engineering to construct and optimize a road graph. It provides a user-friendly interface for selecting nodes and visualizing optimal routes on a map, leveraging MongoDB for data storage and Google Maps API for visualization. The core ACO algorithm is designed to find shortest paths efficiently, simulating the behavior of ants in nature.
